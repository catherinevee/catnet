# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

CatNet is currently in active development. Security updates are provided for:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Create a Public Issue

Security vulnerabilities should **never** be reported through public GitHub issues.

### 2. Report Privately

Please report vulnerabilities through one of these channels:
- Create a [private security advisory](https://github.com/catherinevee/catnet/security/advisories/new) on GitHub
- Open a private issue with details

### 3. Information to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What can an attacker achieve?
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of CatNet are affected?
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas on how to fix it
- **Your Contact**: How we can reach you for follow-up

### 4. What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 1-2 weeks
  - Medium: 2-4 weeks
  - Low: Next release

## Security Features

CatNet implements multiple security layers:

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Multi-factor authentication (TOTP)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management with timeout

### Encryption
- AES-256-GCM for data at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- RSA/GPG signing for configurations
- Argon2 for password hashing

### Secrets Management
- HashiCorp Vault integration
- No hardcoded credentials
- Temporary credential generation
- Automated secret rotation

### Audit & Compliance
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Immutable audit trail
- Session recording for device access
- Compliance reporting

## Security Best Practices

When using CatNet:

### 1. Strong Passwords
- Use complex passwords (minimum 12 characters)
- Enable MFA for all users
- Rotate passwords regularly

### 2. Network Security
- Deploy behind a firewall
- Use VPN for remote access
- Implement network segmentation
- Enable rate limiting

### 3. Access Control
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews
- Remove unused accounts
- Monitor privileged access

### 4. Monitoring
- Enable all audit logging
- Monitor for anomalies
- Set up alerting for failures
- Regular security reviews

## Security Testing

CatNet undergoes regular security testing:

- **Static Analysis**: Bandit for Python code
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety for known vulnerabilities
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy for Docker images
- **Secret Scanning**: GitLeaks for committed secrets

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Default Credentials**: The system creates a default admin account on first run. **Change this immediately**.
2. **Development Mode**: Never run with `--debug` in production
3. **Database Encryption**: Ensure PostgreSQL TDE is enabled
4. **Vault Requirement**: Production deployments require HashiCorp Vault

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] Hardware security module (HSM) support
- [ ] Certificate pinning
- [ ] Advanced threat detection
- [ ] Zero-trust architecture improvements

## Security Headers

When deployed, ensure these headers are configured:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

## Compliance

CatNet is designed to help meet:
- PCI DSS (network segmentation)
- SOC 2 (audit logging)
- ISO 27001 (access control)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework

## Security Resources

- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [CIS Controls](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/)
- [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)

## Contact

For security concerns, contact the maintainers:
- GitHub Security Advisory (preferred)
- Project maintainers via GitHub

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge security researchers who help improve CatNet's security.
