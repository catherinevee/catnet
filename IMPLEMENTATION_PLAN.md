#### Scenario 1: End-to-End Deployment
```gherkin
Given a configuration in Git repository
When a commit is pushed to main branch
Then the webhook triggers validation
And deployment is created with approval required
When 2 approvals are received
Then deployment executes using canary strategy
And devices are configured successfully
```

#### Scenario 2: Emergency Rollback
```gherkin
Given a failed deployment in progress
When rollback is triggered
Then configuration is reverted on all devices
And previous configuration is restored
And incident is logged
```

#### Scenario 3: Multi-Vendor Deployment
```gherkin
Given a mixed environment with Cisco and Juniper
When configuration is deployed
Then vendor-specific handlers are used
And all devices are configured correctly
```
